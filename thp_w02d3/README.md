Program 3: 6th without elevator
  Program in which a nice person will have to climb 10 steps according to a dice roll. A computer version of the goose game in a way!
The player is at the very bottom of a 10-step staircase, and on each turn he will roll a dice:
  - If he rolls 5 or 6, he takes one step forward and the program tells him so (as well as the step he is on now)
  - If he does 1, he gets off one step and the program tells him so (as well as the step he is on now)
  - If he goes 2, 3, or 4 nothing happens, and the program tells him so (as well as the step where he stayed)
When the player reaches the 10th step, the program notifies him with a super enthusiastic message, and the game ends.
